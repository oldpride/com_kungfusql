used this guide to have created this component
https://docs.joomla.org/Special:MyLanguage/J3.2:Developing_an_MVC_Component/Developing_a_Basic_Component

zip -r $WINHOME/Downloads/com_kungfusql001.zip com_kungfusql

keep component name in lower case; otherwise, joomla may not be able to find it even after
successful installation.

v0.0.1,
   the following works
      https://mysite.org/LCA2/administrator/index.php?option=com_kungfusql
      Components->Kung Fu SQL 
      Extenstions->Manage->Manage, search Kung Fu SQL

v0.0.2, added view
   the following works
      https://mysite.org/LCA2/index.php?option=com_kungfusql
   Caveat: 
      If your view needs to load or otherwise embed individual JavaScript code, do not do that
      in the view, as the code might not get included when caching is enabled. Load those scripts
      in the controller instead

v0.0.3, added Menu
   the following works
      Menues->Manage->Main Menu->New->select Menu Type, we should "Kung Fu SQL".
      i am able to use it to add a new menu. 
      tested access control, works

v0.0.4, add models, 
   this is for internal change, no exteral effect yet

v0.0.5, add request variable in menu, 
   joomla available field types: https://docs.joomla.org/Standard_form_field_types
   sql is multiline input, therefore, we used type=editor and filter=raw

   checked #_menu table, params link
      index.php?option=com_kungfusql&view=kungfusql&sql=...

   the sql data is able to pass down but becomes one line: the comment is mixed in. bad

v0.0.6 add database
   #__kungfusql table created
   note to use backticks to enclose the `#__tableName` and column names, eg
      DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `#__kungfusql`;

      INSERT INTO `#__kungfusql` (`filename`) VALUES
      ('example1,sql'),
      ('example2,sql')
   #__schema updated with 0.0.6 for extension id 879

   q: why do you name it HelloWorlds with a plural? why not to stay with HelloWorld, a singular?
   a: Generally Joomla uses the plural when it's referring to the admin form which presents a number of records (eg articles, contacts) and the singular when it's referring to just one record, as in editing a single article or contact. So the controllers and views follow that convention, and this makes the code more modular, although the "singular" model handles the updates for both individual records and batches of records, in order to avoid code duplication. Third party extensions which I've seen also follow the Joomla pattern, so it's best to adopt it.

v0.0.7 add backend
   components->Kung Fu Sql set up. publish button is not working yet, needs more coding

v0.0.8 add language translation
   i didn't do this

v0.0.9 add backend actions
   added New/Edit/Delete actions

from this step, tried to go by my own

v0.1.0 i tried to add an file upload feature, never worked. therefore i gave up the upload feature.

v0.1.1
   stay with manul upload for now
   uploaded sqls to admininstrator/uploads/com_kungfusql
   added logic to check filename exists under admininstrator/uploads/com_kungfusql
   added delete-file-from-file-system logic
   added debug-mode to menu

v0.1.2 
   tried to add ajax to throttle the user query frequency, not successful.
   used $_SESSION variable to throttle user query frequency, working.
    

-------------------------------------------------------------

full cycle

use cpanel file manager
   upload the sql to administrator/uploads/com_kungfusql
   note administrator/uploads/com_kungfusql is outside module installation, therefore, will not
   be removed during uninstall.

Components->Kung Fu Sql, 
   add an entry to this sql file name

Menu->Main Menu, 
   add a new menu, 
   menu type: Kung Fu SQL
   select SQL file name
   set Params, up to 3
   change Debug mode if needed
   Parenet Menu
   Access
